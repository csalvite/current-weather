# current-weather

Current Weather is a simple app made by a bored developer using Vanilla JS, it is designed to display something simple like current weather, temperature, wind speed and humidity in your area.

The data has been managed from the OpenWeatherMap api and the style of the page is designed to be viewed from mobile devices, although it is responsive.
